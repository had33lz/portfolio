# ðŸŒ† 3D Light Pole Portfolio

A creative, interactive portfolio built with **React + Three.js**, deployed with **GitHub Pages**.  

## âœ¨ Concept
The portfolio is presented as a **street light pole in 3D**.  
- A **real-time analog clock** sits on top.  
- **Directional glowing signs** hang from the pole, linking to sections like:
  - About
  - Skills
  - Projects
  - Education
  - Contact & Links  

The **background dynamically changes** with the time of day:
- ðŸŒ… Morning: pastel sky with golden glow  
- ðŸŒž Afternoon: bright sky, sharp shadows  
- ðŸŒ‡ Evening: warm gradient sunset  
- ðŸŒŒ Night: navy sky with stars + glowing lamp  

## ðŸŽ® Interactivity
- Hover over a sign â†’ it glows & wiggles.  
- Click â†’ camera pans to that section.  
- Subtle **3D parallax** on pole & signs with mouse movement.  
- Ambient details: birds in morning, neon flickers at night, stars twinkling.
